# QUESTION 7:
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# What happens when the following code is executed; does the family's data get
# ranshacked? Why or why not?

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

mess_with_demographics(munsters)

p munsters

# Yes, the family's data gets ransacked; throughout the code the method is
# referencing the ID of the munsters hash itself and not a copy of it.
