# PROBLEM: PARENT CLASS

# Use irb to run the following code:

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect

#   You should find that it prints a list of all of the public methods available to the String s;
# this includes not only those methods defined in the String class, but also methods that are
# inherited from Object (which inherits other methods from the BasicObject class and the Kernel module).
# That's a lot of methods.

#   How would you modify this code to print just the public methods that are defined or overridden by the
# String class? That is, the list should exclude all members that are only defined in Object, BasicObject,
# and Kernel.

# For hints on how to proceed next, we look at rubydoc Object#public_methods
#   public_methods(all=true) -> array
#   Returns the list of public methods accessible to obj.  If the all parameter
# is set to false, only those methods in the receiver will be listed:
puts s.public_methods(false).inspect
